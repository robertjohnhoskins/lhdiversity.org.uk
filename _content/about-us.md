Local Heroes is project that was piloted by Devon and Cornwall Police in the autumn of 2013 to help schools address issues of intolerance and discrimation and deliver parts of the PSHE curriculum in a new and exciting way.

**As well as providing PSHE (personal wellbeing) education, Local Heroes has three clear objectives:**

- Challenge intolerance amongst young people
- Give young people from all backgrounds the power to achieve their full potential
- Inspire young people to become responsible citizens who make a positive contribution to society

Now launched as an independent Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO) Local Heroes is expanding its work beyond the borders of Devon and Cornwall to help schools around the country to fulfil their legal responsibilities and deliver parts of the PSHE curriculum in a new and exciting ways.  Students work with Local Heroes at our roadshows to talk about issues of race, gender, sexuality, disability and sub-cultures and see the impact that intolerance has.

They will take back what they have learned and become ambassadors for Local Heroes in their schools, sharing what they have learnt and getting the debate started with their classmates.

Outside the roadshows we have materials to download and over the coming months look out for twitter Q&As with more Local Heroes and other Local Heroes' events.
