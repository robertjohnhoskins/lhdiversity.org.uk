Local Heroes will make a difference.

**Because of it young people will be able to:**

- Demonstrate respect for and acceptance of the differences between people, and challenge offensive behaviour, prejudice and discrimination assertively and safely
- Use social skills to build and maintain a range of positive relationships, reflect upon what makes these successful and apply this to new situations
- Use strategies for resisting unhelpful peer pressure and identify how managing feelings and emotions effectively supports risk management and decision making
- Reflect critically on their own and others values, strengths and achievements, recognise their value and use this learn and develop
