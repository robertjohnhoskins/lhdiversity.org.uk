## What is Hate Crime and what is a Hate Incident?

A Hate Crime is any crime committed against someone because of their disability, gender-identity, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation. It is also a Hate Crime if the offender believes the victim to be a member of a particular group, even if they're not – this means that anyone can be a victim of Hate Crime.

A Hate Incident is similar to a Hate Crime, but ris when someone is subjected to hateful behaviour but no criminal offence is committed so that could be being continually ignored at school or in your community or refused service at a shop. Hate Incidents can feel like crimes to those who suffer them and often escalate to crimes or tension in a community. For this reason the police are still concerned about incidents and want to hear about them. Although the police can only prosecute when the law is broken they will still work with partner agencies (local authorities, charities, community groups etc) to try and prevent things getting worse.

If a person is bullied as a result of their disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity, this is also dealt with either as a hate crime or non-crime hate incident. Bullying could include name-calling, being spat at or kicked, or having your things taken or damaged.

## What can you do?

Tell someone; the police, a teacher, your parents or a friend maybe. Hate crimes and incidents hurt; they can be confusing and frightening and can have a huge impact on the person or people they affect. There are a number of ways you can report a hate crime, whether you have been a victim, a witness, or you are reporting on behalf of someone else.

By reporting them when they happen to you, you may be able to prevent these incidents from happening to someone else. You will also help the police understand the extent of hate crime in your local area so they can better respond to it.

Reporting makes a difference - to you, your friends, and your life.

Where can I report Hate Crime and Hate Incidents?

Talking directly to the police is not the only way to report Hate Crime and Hate Incidents:

### 1. Emergencies

If the Hate Crime or Hate Incident that you want to report is happening there and then, and someone needs urgent help you should call the Police on 999 or 112. If you cannot make voice calls, you can now contact the 999 emergency services by SMS text from your mobile phone. However, you will only be able to use this service if you have registered with emergencySMS first. Go to www.emergencysms.org.uk for details

### 2. 101 the non-emergency contact for the police

The non-emergency phone number for the police in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales is 101. When you call 101, the system will determine your location and connect you to the police force covering that area. You will hear a recorded message announcing the police force you are being connected to and you will be given a choice of which force to be connected to. Calls to 101 are answered by police officers and staff in the control room of the local police force. This ensures that staff with local knowledge can answer and deal with the calls and respond appropriately. If you are deaf or hard of hearing you can you can textphone 18001 101

Remember, you do not have to give your personal details, but please be aware the investigation and ability to prosecute the offender(s) is severely limited if the police cannot contact you.
