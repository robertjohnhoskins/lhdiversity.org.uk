## What is Hate Crime and what is a Hate Incident?

A Hate Crime is any crime committed against someone because of their disability, gender-identity, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation. It is also a Hate Crime if the offender believes the victim to be a member of a particular group, even if they are not – this means that anyone can be a victim of Hate Crime.

A Hate Incident is similar to a Hate Crime, but relates to those occasions when a person is subjected to hateful behaviour but no criminal offence is committed – for example, being continually ignored at school or in your community or refused service in  a shop. Hate Incidents can feel like crimes to those who suffer them and often escalate to crimes or tension in a community. For this reason the police are still concerned about incidents and want to hear about them. Although the police can only prosecute when the law is broken they will still work with partner agencies (local authorities, charities, community groups etc) to try and prevent things getting worse.

If a person is bullied as a result of their disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity, this is also dealt with either as a hate crime or non-crime hate incident. Bullying could include name-calling, being spat at or kicked, or having your things taken or damaged.

## Why is this important for my School?

It is estimated that 69% of children are bullied at some point with some groups being particularly vulnerable (such as those who identify as homosexual or have disabilities). Bullying has significant short and long term effects on young people's lives. Approximately 16,000 young people aged 11-15 are absent from school at any one time due to bullying. 25% of young people worry about bullying and at the far end of the spectrum, around half of 12 year olds who harm themselves are bullied.

According to Ofsted, “The contribution that effective PSHE education can make to good behaviour and safety and to pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development is evident...there is a close correlation between the grades that the schools in the survey were awarded for overall effectiveness in their last section 5 inspections, and their grade for PSHE education”. Furthermore, a recent Department for Education (DfE) research report states that, “Children with higher levels of emotional, behavioural, social and school well-being on average have higher levels of academic achievement and are more engaged in school, both concurrently and in later years”.

Ofsted make it clear in their inspection guidance that when reporting on the quality of education in a school they must also consider:

- the behaviour and safety of pupils at the school  
- the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils at the school
- evaluating the extent to which schools provide an inclusive environment that meets the needs of all pupils, irrespective of age, disability, gender, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation
- Prejudiced based bullying is a safeguarding issue. The effective tackling of it will allow schools to achieve higher scores in their inspections and (more importantly) allows students to achieve their full academic potential.

## How does Local Heroes help?

Our approach is unique. Working directly with school students we deliver in and out of school learning that is lead by trained youth workers and celebrities (our Heroes). At our free roadshows local schools send students to attend a day of tailored youth work sessions discussing and debating issues surrounding race/religion, sexual orientation, gender, disability and sub-culture. These sessions are led by trained youth workers with the support of a celebrity Hero and allow the students to talk freely without the input of their teachers. The students become Local Heroes Ambassadors and return to their schools equipped with the confidence, support and materials to deliver peer-2-peer sessions and ensure that this learning becomes embedded into the PSHE curriculum and the culture of their school. The feedback we receive from young people has included comments such as:  “People who have been through a lot can overcome it and show the bullies they have changed”, “It was great hearing other people’s stories, knowing I’m not the only one”, “People need to stand up for each other and stop things” and “I’m going to raise awareness in my own school about diversity, race, sexuality etc”

We know that PSHE education is a non-statutory subject. However, the great majority of schools choose to teach it because it makes a major contribution to their statutory responsibilities to promote children and young people’s personal and economic well-being. According to Ofsted, “In 80% of primary and secondary schools, outside speakers made a valuable contribution by bringing a wide range of expertise and life experiences to the PSHE education programme”. Local Heroes has a proven ability to deliver high quality education and awareness that inspires young people to make a difference. If you want your students to benefit from Local Heroes get in touch with us so we can talk about them taking part.
