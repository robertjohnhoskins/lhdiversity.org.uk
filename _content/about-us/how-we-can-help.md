## What is Hate Crime and what is a Hate Incident?

A Hate Crime is any crime committed against someone because of their disability, gender-identity, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation. It is also a Hate Crime if the offender believes the victim to be a member of a particular group, even if they are not – this means that anyone can be a victim of Hate Crime.

A Hate Incident is similar to a Hate Crime, but relates to those occasions when a person is subjected to hateful behaviour but no criminal offence is committed – for example, being continually ignored at school or in your community or refused service in  a shop. Hate Incidents can feel like crimes to those who suffer them and often escalate to crimes or tension in a community. For this reason the police are still concerned about incidents and want to hear about them. Although the police can only prosecute when the law is broken they will still work with partner agencies (local authorities, charities, community groups etc) to try and prevent things getting worse.

If a person is bullied as a result of their disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity, this is also dealt with either as a hate crime or non-crime hate incident. Bullying could include name-calling, being spat at or kicked, or having your things taken or damaged.

## What can I do?

Be aware and take it seriously. Hate crimes and incidents hurt; being young is a time for learning about yourself and the world around you and Hate Crimes and Incidents can have a huge impact on the person or people they affect. If you believe that your child or the young person you care for is being subjected to Hate, please report it. By reporting them when they happen, you may be able to prevent these incidents from happening to someone else. You will also help the police understand the extent of hate crime in your local area so they can better respond to it.

Reporting makes a difference - to young people, their friends, and their life.

## Where can I report Hate Crime and Hate Incidents?

Talking directly to the police is not the only way to report Hate Crime and Hate Incidents:

### 1. Emergencies

If the Hate Crime or Hate Incident that you want to report is happening there and then, and someone needs urgent help you should call the Police on 999 or 112. If you cannot make voice calls, you can now contact the 999 emergency services by SMS text from your mobile phone. However, you will only be able to use this service if you have registered with emergencySMS first. Go to www.emergencysms.org.uk for details

### 2. Non-emergency contact with the police

The non-emergency phone number for the police in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales is 101. When you call 101, the system will determine your location and connect you to the police force covering that area. You will hear a recorded message announcing the police force you are being connected to and you will be given a choice of which force to be connected to. Calls to 101 are answered by police officers and staff in the control room of the local police force. This ensures that staff with local knowledge can answer and deal with the calls and respond appropriately. If you are deaf or hard of hearing you can you can textphone 18001 101

Remember, you do not have to give your personal details, but please be aware the investigation and ability to prosecute the offender(s) is severely limited if the police cannot contact you.

### 3. True Vision

True Vision is a website that provides information for victims and the public and support and advice on Hate Crime and Hate Incident related issues. You can report Hate Crimes through the True Vision online reporting form or download their self reporting form which can then be sent to you local police force. There is even an easy read version of the form. You can visit True Vision at www.report-it.org.uk.

## How does Local Heroes help?

Our approach is unique. Working directly with school students we deliver in and out of school learning that is lead by trained youth workers and celebrities (our Heroes). At our free roadshows local schools send students to attend a day of tailored youth work sessions discussing and debating issues surrounding race/religion, sexual orientation, gender, disability and sub-culture. These sessions are led by trained youth workers with the support of a celebrity Hero and allow the students to talk freely without the input of their teachers. The students become Local Heroes Ambassadors and return to their schools equipped with the confidence, support and materials to deliver peer-2-peer sessions and ensure that this learning becomes embedded into the PSHE curriculum and the culture of their school.

The feedback we receive from young people has included comments such as:  “People who have been through a lot can overcome it and show the bullies they have changed”, “It was great hearing other people’s stories, knowing I’m not the only one”, “People need to stand up for each other and stop things” and “I’m going to raise awareness in my own school about diversity, race, sexuality etc”

If you want your child or the young person you care for to benefit from Local Heroes tell us, or tell their school to get in touch with us so we can talk about them taking part.
