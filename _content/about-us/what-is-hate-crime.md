A hate crime is any hate incident which constitutes a criminal offence and the victim or any other person believes it to be motivated by prejudice or hate.

Police record this if the victim or another person believes it is motivated by the hatred of someone because of a particular factor. Those factors include:

- A person's disability
- Their race, ethnicity or nationality
- Their sexual orientation
- Their religion or belief
- Their transgender identity
- Hate crime can be against the person, or the person's property.

Hate crime doesn't just affect the individual person it is aimed at. It can have a major impact on whole communities.

**A hate incident is any non-Criminal incident**

A hate incident is perceived by the victim or any other person to be motivated by hostility or prejudice. This may be an incident involving prejudicial behaviour where the criminal threshold isn’t met, such as being excluded from a barber’s shop for being transgender, or being called names.

**No-one should have to live in fear or anxiety. You do not have to suffer in silence. We urge you to report hate crime and incidents.**

## How to Report

You can report Hate Crime and incidents directly to your local police, or through a “Third party” reporting mechanism.

Police:

If it is an emergency where life is threatened, people are injured or offenders are nearby and an urgent response is required, ring 999. If it is not an emergency you should call 101. By reporting a hate crime/incident to the police, it will be recorded and investigated as appropriate. The minimum detail required to make a report of a hate crime/incident is

- What happened
- Where it happened
- When it happened

### Third Parties

This means if you do not want to speak to the police yourself, you or a friend can do it through a specially trained people who will do it on your behalf. Such as:
