Listen2Win Ltd was founded in 2012 when an Exeter Businessman, Richard Carpenter, heard Robin and Keryn talk briefly at a lunch prior to their Paralympian debut.

Fascinated by their humour, modesty and determination he was devastated to learn that they were very poorly financially supported despite their fantastic achievements both personally and for their country.

Listen2win has become the vehicle, not only help sustain them long into the future but, to enable organisations like yours to benefit from the highly engaging, inspiring style of delivery and tangible results the boys have developed from many years of dedication to their sport.
