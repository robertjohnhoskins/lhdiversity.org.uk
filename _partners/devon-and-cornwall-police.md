Devon and Cornwall Police is delighted to support Local Heroes and Inspector Ryan Doyle in their campaign to educate young people across the UK about hate crime and to raise awareness of intolerance. It is hoped that by enabling and empowering young people to recognise hate crime they will have the confidence to report incidents to police and that every effort can be made to prevent and reduce this type of crime occurring.
