Chris Opie is a professional cyclist who cycles for UKYouth.  He took up cycling 16 years ago as a hobby and has been fortunate enough to see his passion for competition and cycling turn into a career.

Cycling as a sport, has enjoyed a massive growth in popularity recently, but throughout the early years it was very much a minority sport. It is because of this that Chris says he learnt to embrace the sport, despite the reactions he received.

Chris says: 'Being proud of who you are and what you are doing is key to happiness and self confidence in life, something to which everyone is entitled.'
