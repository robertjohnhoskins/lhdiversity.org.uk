Gemma Oaten, perhaps better known to you as Emmerdale's Rachel Breckle, has joined the Local Heroes' family.

Gemma has personal experience of the imapct of bullying in her childhood and is a passionate supporter of anti-bullying causes.  We are delighted to be one of the causes that she vocally supports.  Local Heroes met Gemma only a few weeks ago but she was eager to show her support.

*"Speaking of my experience at The Ben Cohen Stand up foundation Gala, I met some amazing charities and people in that room. One being the Local Heroes charity. I was so drawn to their cause, to stop hate crime and accept diversity. I want to stand up for being a survivor of hate and bullying and am thrilled to be supporting an amazing charity that do just that!"*

It's great to welcome Gemma and we're looking forward to working with her to #calltimeout on hate crime!
