Katherine is a 2010 Commonwealth Gold and Silver Medallist from 2010 for the 4x100m Relay and 100m, having also competed at the World and European Championships and the British Grand Prix.

She first broke into the Great Britain Squad at the age of 21. Despite having such great success, Katherine has also faced many setbacks within her career as a professional athlete. Having undergone six surgical procedures to overcome injury, she is also an insulin dependent diabetic, as well as having time off to give birth to her daughter in 2007.

In November 2012 she was awarded an Honorary Masters Degree of Science from University College Plymouth ST Mark & ST John.

Throughout her sporting career, she has been fortunate enough to travel the world and experience different cultures, beliefs, meet and compete alongside a mix diverse of people, celebrating the achievements of the host nations and the podium athletes, all standing together in celebration of diversity

**Katherine says:** *‘It is important celebrate diversity in everyday life, regardless of who we are or where we come from.’*

*‘I am proud to be a Local Heroes Ambassador so I can help inspire the next generation and share with them my own knowledge, experiences, and difficulties I have faced personally throughout  my athletics career; if it wasn't for my love of sport, determination, and self-belief I would not have achieved anything.’*

*'Local Heroes is a excellent opportunity and a fantastic way of getting the message of intolerance across to young people, through our own personal experience and support, and hope that it will make a difference to someone’s life.'*
