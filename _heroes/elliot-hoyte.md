My name is Elliot Hoyte, I was born in Plymouth and grew up in a small town called Tavistock living with my parents and younger sister and I currently live in Boise Idaho in the United States. I played every sport I could at a young age. But up until the age of 16, rugby was my primary sport. I took up American Football at 16 after pestering my Dad to take me; the nearest youth team to me was the Bristol Aztecs which meant traveling for 2 hours to get there at least once a week and of course away games being an even longer journey. I was still playing rugby for Ivybridge Community College, an academy of Exeter Chiefs at the age of 17 whilst playing football.

I left England for America January the 9th 2012 and enrolled early for the 2012-2013 season at Boise State. I currently study Communications and I am in my second season here at BSU. I am on an athletic scholarship and I play American Football for our University team the Boise State Broncos and we compete in the mountain west conference. American Football is a big deal out here and we usually get anywhere from 30,000 – 100,000 fans at games depending on where we play at!

When I finish my time here at Boise State I would like to use my degree to enter the media industry. Journalism and cinema interest me a lot and I soon plan on looking at possible careers paths that my degree will help lead me down.

I have faced a few situations of discrimination due to my race over the years, they impacted me much more when I was younger as I couldn’t understand what was happening so well.

When I was in primary school I was often made fun of by kids who didn’t know me very well, sometimes they wouldn’t want to play with me because I was different colour and they thought something was wrong with me. I remember a group of boys once chased me around at lunch time making fun of me calling me names and wouldn’t leave me alone until I ignored them.

I noticed as I got older it was a lot more subtle; being a much bigger than average person I can be intimidating enough already. Unfortunately coupled with my size, my colour sometimes did and still does intimidate people, I notice the look of concern on strangers faces (particularly wElliot3hite females) when they are in my presence. So I have learned to be as polite as possible and try and break those stereotypes people have of me.

**As I have gotten older I have learned to turn a blind eye to it, and I actually use discrimination as motivation to better myself. I learned that it’s ok to be different.**
