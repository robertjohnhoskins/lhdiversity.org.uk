Entrepreneur, artist and trendsetter, Brian Friedman is one of today's most in demand creative director/choreographers for popular concerts, tours, music videos, television shows, commercials, and films.  But he has still found time in his crammed schedule to join Local Heroes!!

Brian has directed and/or choreographed some of the most popular and ground-breaking music videos and performances such as Britney Spears "Toxic" and "Slave 4 U," "My Love Is Like Wo" by Mya, "The One" by Prince, NSYNC's "Dirty Pop," and many more for such artists as Justin Bieber, Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, Usher, Pink, Ne-Yo, Brittany Murphy, Christina Aguilera, Nicole Scherzinger, The Wanted, Carly Rae Jepsen, Karmin and Rihanna.

Brian is a familiar face on both sides of the pond as a judge and choreographer on the hit US show So You Think You Can Dance. Simon Cowell brought Brian to London for The X Factor creating a brand new on-camera position specifically for Brian as creative director. Brian has served as creative director and choreographer for multiple seasons of The X Factor in the UK, as well as on other reality competition shows such as American Idol, The Voice Australia, and The X Factor (US version).

So why has Brian agreed to join us?

*"I am honoured to support the charity and be a hero… growing up as a child of bullying, I believe it is my duty to help anyone today who may be struggling with bullying of their own and let them know that it will change and that life does get better.

The only way that we can help each other and make it a more tolerant world to grow up in, is to spread the knowledge to our youth and help promote embracing each other’s differences. These differences are what make each of our lights shine bright!

I never knew growing up that I wasn’t alone and had I known then what I know now, I am positive I would have been much stronger!”*

Everyone at Local Heroes is so excited that Brian has agreed to join us and help us #calltimeout on bullying.
