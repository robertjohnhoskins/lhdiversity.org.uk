Mat and Jon Price, are twin brothers who set up the Proud2Be Project CIC in May 2012, to encourage and support all lesbian, gay, bisexual & trans (LGBT) people to be proud of who they are by helping to raise self esteem and self worth in such individuals. The project also aims to be part of a social and cultural change that makes it safe for LGBT people to be proud and to also educate and support the family, friends, co-workers and educators of all LGBT people.

Throughout their school lives, the Price brothers have been subject to bullying for being 'different', for being twins, for being overweight, for wearing braces and for being different to other boys our age. These kinds of attack on an individualâ€™s character and uniqueness can stay with somebody for life, but the twins have turned these negative experiences around into an altogether more positive outcome, enabling them to support other people that have been subjected to similar situations.

**Mat and Jon say:** *'We are so proud to be local heroes ambassadors! As young children growing up in a rural area we didn't have any access to LGBT role models. To think that young LGBT people in Devon and Cornwall might see the both of us as proud, successful and happy gay men makes us really happy!'*

*'We both feel that celebrating diversity and challenging any oppressive behaviour is key to making life better for everybody! At Proud2Be we believe that no one should apologise for being themselves. Whether at School, at work or in the home we can all do our bit to nurture diversity and individuality!'*

*'Some people say that bullying is rite of passage and that it is character building. We would disagree and say that to encourage, empower and support a person to be authentically themselves is a far healthier way to prepare them for the adult world. We look forward to joining Local Heroes as part of the solution.'*
