Sarah Guest is the latest international rugby star to cross codes and become a a Local Hero.  

*"Far too many young people suffer as a result of prejudice, ignorance, jealously and intolerance, often because they are just “different” from their peers.

I started playing rugby aged 7 with a local team, but of course, it was unusual to be a girl in boys’ team and some parents raised eyebrows, yet alone players. Some opponents appeared to resent this and at times I was subject to name calling, cynical comments and some harsh treatment on the field. This even manifested itself at Twickenham when I was the only girl to take part in curtain raiser. However, I was determined to succeed and show that I had the determination, mental capacity, physicality and skill to compete in a mixed team.

At aged 12 the RFU Continuum directed that I had to play for a girls’ team, at which point joined Worcester.

I went on to represent at regional, county, England under 19 and 20, England A and England 7’s, being part of the European Cup Winning Teams of 2009 and 2012, also winning the Ladies Premiership Title with Worcester in 2012-13.

Anyone can succeed if they have the willpower and support to do so, I hope to be able to inspire young people to follow in similar footpaths to my own."*
