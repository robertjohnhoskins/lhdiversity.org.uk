Luton-born Daniel came through the MK Dons Academy, signing his first professional contract aged 17. In 2009/10 he spent the majority of the season on loan at Forest Green Rovers and began the 2010/11 season also on loan at Darlington before he returned to the Dons to cement a first team place.

Daniel is the “Kick it Out” ambassador for MK Dons and delighted to become a Local Hero. “It is extremely important to me that I can play such a vital role in raising awareness and educating players and supporters alike about the importance of inclusion within sport and the community.” said Powell.
