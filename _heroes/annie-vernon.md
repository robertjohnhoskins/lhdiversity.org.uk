Annie Vernon recently retired after a ten year career as an international rower.  Annie was fortunate enough to represent her country at seven World Championships and two Olympic Games (Beijing 2008, London 2012); along the way becoming a two time World Champion and Olympic silver medalist.  Talking about her highly successful career and why she felt an affinity with Local Heroes Annie says:

*"Sport is a tough profession which asks huge and constant questions of your body, mind and emotions and early on I realised that I needed rock-solid confidence in myself in order to be able to achieve what I wanted to. The further you get in sport, you more you realise that ability is such a small part of it - character and belief is what separates those who are good from those who are outstanding. For me, my Cornish roots always provided a very strong source of passion and identity for me to draw on when competing against the rest of the world. I was never afraid to fail or fearful of articulating how good I wanted to be because I knew that I was comfortable in my own skin."*
