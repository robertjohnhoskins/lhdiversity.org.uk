Glenn Cosby was the last man standing on the fourth series of The Great British Bake Off, and became known for his enthusiasm, big cakes, humour and fuss-free approach. While the others patiently kneaded their filo dough he let the mixer do the work and had a cup of tea.

After watching the first three series Glenn decided to apply, along with 13,000 other applicants, for series 4 of Bake Off and was completely blown away, but over the moon, to be selected as a contestant.

Since Bake Off ended he has regretfully left teaching to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. He has appeared at the Good Food Show, the Cake and Bake Show, the Big Cake Show, the Exeter Festival of South West Food and Drink and the Devon County Fair. Glenn has written a book entitled Tasty Travels! for the Oxford University Press Reading Tree. He gives baking and cookery tips on BBC Radio Devon and have appeared on regional TV programs such as BBC One’s Spotlight and Inside Out. One of his most exciting new ventures is a one-man show, ‘Bake it Big with Glenn Cosby’, which will be touring the country in 2014. Part demo, part panto, it combines cookery lessons with anecdotes, chat, and audience participation. He will also be taking a one-man show to the Assembly Rooms at the Edinburgh Fringe this August.

Glenn taught English in Teignmouth for seven years and was Head of Sixth Form. As an openly gay teacher he was one of the staff behind creating the school’s Diversity Week which was set up in 2010 to raise the students’ awareness about prejudice.

Glenn tweets at @GlennCosby and has a blog at glenncosby.co.uk.
