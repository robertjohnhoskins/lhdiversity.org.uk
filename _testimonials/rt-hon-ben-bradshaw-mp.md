“The social, cultural and moral education of young people is critical to their development and well being. On average, young people that have benefited from this sort of education are more engaged and more likely to fulfil their academic potential. As well as this, we know that children from minority groups are more likely bullied than those that aren’t and that over half of all hate crimes go unreported. I think the work that organisations, like local heroes, do with young people, can be a great way of pulling all of this together and providing much needed development for students.”
