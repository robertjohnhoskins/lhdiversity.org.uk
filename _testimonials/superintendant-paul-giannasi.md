“Successive UK governments have recognised the damaging impact that hate crime has on our society in general, as well as to individual victims. In 1999 the report of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry exposed many failings in the response to Stephen’s tragic murder in 1993, but it also brought around a significant response which has seen new legislation and data collection and an improved response from criminal justice agencies.

Whilst the UK has emerged as a global leader in responding to hate crime, there are still many challenges to overcome. Amongst the greatest of these challenges is the need to develop effective ways of diverting potential offenders though the influence of educators, peers or role models. Local heroes is an innovative scheme which uses influential individuals to show the value of an inclusive society and will help to reduce hostility. The cross-government hate crime programme feel that this work can help to make our society a safer place for all citizens and we were pleased to support it.”

**Superintendent Paul Giannasi, Head of the Cross-Government Hate Crime Programme**
