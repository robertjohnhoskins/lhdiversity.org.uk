The school holidays are over and everyone in the Local Heroes' office is hard at work pulling together our biggest and best Roadshow programme.  We may have been away for a while but so much has happened.  Here's just a taste of what's going on:

We're going to be launching two totally new programmes in January and are really excitied about that.

The wonderful Brian Friedman and Gemma Oaten have joined our Hero ranks and we have more fabulous new Heroes to announce over the coming weeks.

Our great friend Sachar is now a World Champion and we're totally thrilled about how succesful she is becoming in her sport.

Our Roadshow programme will be bigger and better this year.  We'll be holding 14 across the country in October and November and are delighted to working with some great sports clubs in staging them.  More on those to follow.

This Monday, 7th September, everything will be starting in earnest as the team heads up to Doncaster to deliver some training to......  well that would be telling wouldn't it.

So as we crack on into our new year I wanted to say thank you to all our friends, our Heroes, our partners and our funders.  It's going to be a very exciting year for Local Heroes as we carry on with our mission to#calltimeout on bullying and hate crime.
