2015 has been quite a year for Local Heroes and as we shut up shop until the new year we just wanted to reflect on the year that gone by.

This autumn 43 schools attended our ten LH: Roadshows creating 306 Local Heroes’ student ambassadors.  We're looking forward to visiting AFC Bournemouth, Sturminster Newton and Leicester City FC early in the spring term to complete this series of roadshows.

The young people that we have worked with have again been an inspiration to us. Each makes a pledge about what they will change and here are just a small sample of what they have said that they will do:

“I will stand by anyone who feels uncomfortable or different because of their race, disability or social awareness.  Make sure people are always involved in social activity.  Don’t leave people out just because they may be different.”

“Call time out on hate crime. I will not use gay as a bad word.  Schools should be able to let us be us.”

“Teach myself and others to respect and treat others equally.  Teach the younger years and my own year that being whatever and whoever they want to be is ok.”

“I pledge to help others be informed about the things I learnt today and to tell someone and stop hate crime when it happens.  I shall help people get through hate crime and to try to stop it in every way possible.”

The team (just four of us all part time and volunteers) have also developed two new projects that will be officially launching in the early 2016; LH: Bitesize and our LH: Award.  We're very excitied to be launching these and we must thank the Wessex Youth Trust, IGN Media and the Safer Devon Partnership for their support allowing us to create these new projects.

We'd also like to thank the Safer Dorset Partnership, Ben Cohen Stan Up Foundation, Avon & Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner's Office and the 29th May 1969 Charitable Foundation for their support this year.

In September we spent a day in Doncaster delivering two workshops at the Premiership Rugby National Community Coaches Conference.  We were delighted to work with the coaches and our thanks go out to Tim Mathias at Premiership Rugby for inviting us to take part.

So all in all not a bad year.  We're proud of what we have achieved but are eager for the new year to arrive so we can carry on helping young people #calltimeout on bullying and hate crime.

All that leaves us to do is wish you all a Happy Christmas and a Peaceful 2016!
