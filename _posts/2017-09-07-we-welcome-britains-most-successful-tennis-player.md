Local Heroes is thrilled to announce that Jordanne Whiley MBE is the latest sports' star to become a Hero.  Jordanne, who first picked up a racket at just three, is currently is Britain’s No.1 wheelchair tennis player, world No.5 and No.1 in World doubles rankings.

In 2012, Jordanne partnered Lucy Shuker to win a Bronze medal at the London Paralympic games and became the first ever British women to medal in tennis at a games.  In 2014 she went on to become the first British woman to win a Grand Slam tournament and ended the year having won 4 Grand Slam titles, the Australian, French & US Open and Wimbledon. This year Jordanne has retained her Australian Open and Wimbledon doubles titles and won her first Grand Slam singles title at the US Open.  A remarkable sportswoman who was recently recognised as Disability Sportswoman of the Year for her amazing achievement and was awarded an MBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours' List in 2015.

Jordanne had a difficult time throughout her school years as other children singled her out for being ‘different’.  Being in a wheelchair, she wasn’t able to take part in the regular school activities so the kids would make things difficult for her in various ways.  Brittle Bone Disease (Osteogenesis Imperfecta) was not going to stop Jordanne, who has broken her legs twenty-six times, and she qualified for the Beijing Paralympic games when she was just sixteen.

Admitting she had a lonely childhood, Jordanne found that playing tennis helped her grow in confidence and meet other people who understood who she was.

*“Sport has helped me grow in confidence and appreciate that I have flaws.  I’m proud of who I am and of the success I’ve had so far.  I’m really in support of the Local Heroes campaign.  If just one other person looks at me and is inspired to realise that whatever their own personal challenges, they can still be successful, then I’ll be happy as they will then become the role model to others themselves.”*
