With experience across public, private and charity sectors, Jess lead’s on and offline communications for Local Heroes and is passionate about raising awareness of the impact of bullying and hate crime.

Jessica also works for Devon and Cornwall Police and Young Devon, managing and supporting the PR and Marketing functions within both organisations.

*“The struggle to fit in at school is one that is only too familiar; having been subjected to bullying, working with Local Heroes is an amazing opportunity to support a fantastic initiative in changing attitudes and celebrating uniqueness and individuality. It’s so important for young people facing these difficulties to realise that they aren’t on their own, what they’re experiencing isn’t acceptable and that there is nothing wrong with who they are as a person. 

Local Heroes has already leapt from strength to strength and I can’t wait to see what the future holds - its going to be exciting!”*
