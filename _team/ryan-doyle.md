Inspector Ryan Doyle combines his day job as Strategic Partnerships' Inspector at Devon & Cornwall Police with being the Chair of Local Heroes.  It is through his hard work, commitment and passion that Local Heroes has grown from being an idea on a push bike to the what we have today.

*"I started Local Heroes for the same reason I joined the Police service; to make a positive impact on society. I have been a police officer for 11 years and the development of Local Heroes is one of my proudest achievements. We have been fortunate to work with some truly inspirational heroes and young people and the plans that the team and I have for the future means that Local Heroes will continue to get better and better.

I came up with the idea whilst cycling! I wanted to devise a project that targeted the future leaders, teachers and parents that are currently students in our schools. I wanted to breed a culture that was proactive in its challenge of intolerance and celebration of diversity.  I don't want young people to be targetted by bullies because they are different, I want them to be recognised and lauded by their peers. The idea of using local heroes was to show young people that you can really achieve something special if you put your mind to it. I also felt that the messages were more likely to be heard by young people if they were delivered by heroes rather than boring old teachers and police officers!!"*
