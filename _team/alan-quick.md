Equalities and diversity campaigner Alan Quick was recognised by Intercom Lynx South West in 2006 for his work in opposing homophobia in the South West of England.

He was involved, from the beginning, with Intercom and a few other volunteers, in establishing Exeter Pride.  It has become the South West's biggest and free annual LGBT Pride event.  Alan was chairman of Exeter Pride for three years and is still a trustee with the organising committee.  In recent years Alan has contributed to or helped write some national equality documents and educational material.

Alan is the editor of a Devon weekly newspaper and has been a DJ for 35 years, including on the gay scene.  Formerly he promoted the South West's biggest gay club night, Boxes on Tuesday, in Exeter, which supported a number of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) charities and organisations.  One of those who attended Boxes on Tuesday was the first Â£1 million black footballer, Justin Fashanu, who was also the first and, to date, only UK professional footballer to come out as gay.  Justin suffered both racism and homophobia and it was in 1998 that he took his own life.

Alan has been actively campaigning against racism and homophobia since the death of his late friend.  He is involved in campaigns against inequalities in football with The Justin Campaign and Football v Homophobia.

He is a member of Exeter City Football Club's One Game One Community group, is a supporter of Devon Lions Football Club, Kick It Out and Devon FA's Inclusion Advisory Group.  Alan has contributed to two books about Justin Fashanu.  He has also exhibited an historical display of memorabilia about Justin at venues across the UK in support of LGBT events and those opposing homophobia and racism.

In other areas, he is also a trustee of the Community Council of Devon and is involved in the organisation of the Dartmoor Folk Festival.

Alan said he is "extremely proud to support Local Heroes and help it to raise awareness of hate crime and empower young people to celebrate diversity, challenge intolerance and make a positive contribution to society".
