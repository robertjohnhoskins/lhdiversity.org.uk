Tom was born in Wales in 1984, where he lived until 1991 before moving to Ivybridge in Devon where he spent the rest of my childhood here studying at Ivybridge Community College.  After completing his degree in International Relations with Politics from Plymouth in 2006 he moved into retail management with Ted Baker in Bristol before returning to Plymouth for a couple of years before enrolling in an MSc Marketing Management and Strategy course at Plymouth Business School in the summer of 2011. With his MSc and CIM Professional Diploma under his belt, he accepted a role with Leicester City Football Club as CRM Marketing Executive where he worked for over a year before joining Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club as Marketing Manager.

*“As a child who attended six different schools during my younger years I learnt the hard way how important fitting in is to children and that having anything about you which makes you stand out can make you a target for discrimination and bullying. The key is educating young children to the harm of discrimination to prevent it spreading; this is what Local Heroes is all about and why I am completely supportive of their work. I am looking forward to hosting them at Molineux for a roadshow in November.”*

 Tom currently lives in Birmingham City Centre, enjoying all that big city living has to offer
