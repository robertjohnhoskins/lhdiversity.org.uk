Before becoming a school teacher Glenn travelled and lived in France, Spain and Australia working in EFL teaching, sales, recruitment and publishing.

Ten years ago he decided to leave the corporate world and undertook a PGCE and trained to be a secondary English teacher. In just his second year of teaching he was appointed Assistant Principal and Director of Sixth Form, a position he loved. In this role he particularly enjoyed shaping the pastoral care for his students and creating a new Diversity policy for the school.

As one of the few openly gay teachers working in Devon he was delighted to be asked to work with Local Heroes, in his spare time Glenn loves to cook and bake and appeared on The Great British Bake Off in 2013. He didnâ€™t win.
