Lisa's career has been in Education and Employment Law and for the last eleven years she has had a specific interest in Disability Rights and Special Needs provision for disabled people, their parents and carers.

*I'm mother to my eleven year old and ten year old sons, the eldest of which has severe learning disability and moderate physical disability. My life this past decade has incorporated more learning and  social networking than either of my careers in the Education system or the Department of Constitutional Affairs gave me!*

Lisa has taken numerous voluntary posts since the birth of her children with various South West care providers. She has worked with Devon Portage, and the Joint Agency Team for Children & Young Peoples Services, Barnardo's plus Action for Children in an SEN advisory role.

Lisa is training to become a regional Makaton tutor (signing and total communication aid) to advance her communication within a diverse role and to better assist her son in his own personal development!

This is my first post as a trustee and I'm excited at the potential for change that Local Heroes will be providing.

*I'm hoping my experience past and present will contribute positively to what I already know is a fabulous initiative.*
