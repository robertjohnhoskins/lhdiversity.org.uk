# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Local Heroes is a growing hate crime awareness charity that exists to inspire young people from all backgrounds to maximise their potential and the role they play in society. We work with “local heroes” to raise awareness of prejudice and hate crime; inspiring children and young people to celebrate diversity, value difference, nurture change and prevent prejudice based bullying.
